its main purpose is because of allocators that introduced in cpp11 and they were part of type of conatiner. and when you
want to pass a vector of ints to another vector of ints that have custom allocator there were compile error. it is not 
makes sense. so by using runtime polymorphism we could solve this problem. std::pmr::<containers> solve this by using a
base class named std::pmr::polymorfic_allocator and std::pmr::memory_resource.
