1. change cpu frequencies to high for testing:
	sudo cpupower frequency-set --governor performance

2. to see which ports are in used:
	sudo netstat -tuln

3. to format a usb
	3.1. see mounted devices and their mountpoins: lsblik
	3.2. unmount the device: sudo umount <dev or mountpoint>
	3.3. format it by any type you want(right now i prefer F32): sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 -I <dev>
	3.3. optionally you could write all of the bytes in usb by zero using this command: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<usb> bs=<size-of-usb> status=progress
