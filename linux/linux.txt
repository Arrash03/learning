1. change cpu frequencies to high for testing:
	sudo cpupower frequency-set --governor performance

2. to see which ports are in used:
	sudo netstat -tuln

3. to format a usb
	3.1. see mounted devices and their mountpoins: lsblik
	3.2. unmount the device: sudo umount <dev or mountpoint>
	3.3. format it by any type you want(right now i prefer F32): sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 -I <dev>
	3.3. optionally you could write all of the bytes in usb by zero using this command: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<usb> bs=<size-of-usb> status=progress

4. sync time
	4.1. enable it for doing automatically:	sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
	you can sync it manually: sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd

5. set time manually
	5.1. disable automatic synchronization: sudo timedatectl set-ntp false
	5.2. sudo timedatectl set-time 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
	5.3. see the status: timedatectl

6. Change view of process to kernel: setarch
	5.1. change what 'uname -m' will return for process(setarch i386 <command>)
	5.2. could disable Addres Space Randomization(ASLR) for that process(setarch -R <command>)
